# :cloud: weather_app

A tiny weather app to showcase one of the various ways to structure a Flutter app.

## Getting Started

Assuming you have [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) installed, the only thing you will need is an API key from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/). 

- Go to [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) and create an account if you haven't already.
- Open the [API keys](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) page and copy the key or generate a new one.
- Now go to `lib/store.dart` and replace `YOUR_API_KEY`.
